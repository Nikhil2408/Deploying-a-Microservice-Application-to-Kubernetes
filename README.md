<h2> Microservices </h2>

Microservices are small and independent services that work together to form a whole application. Traditionally, apps use a monolithic architecture. In monolithic architecture, all features and services are part of one layer application but a microservice architecture breaks an application up into a collection of small loosely-coupled service.

Microservices are small - each microservice implements only a small piece of an application's overall functionality. Microservices interact with each other using stable and well defined APIs.
